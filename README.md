# MyReads Project

This is a functional , if small, React project that allows you to search a set of finite set of terms for books to catoragize into shelves. 

You will have two 'pages' to interact with. The first will be the main 'Book Shelf'.
You will have three shelves to place books:
* Currently reading
* Want to Read
* Read

To move a book to a different shelf simply click on the green button and select which option you wish to move said book to.

There is a plus sign button on the bottom right of the main book shelf page that will take you to the 'Search' page.
Once there you can search a finite set of terms, found below, which will generate a grid of books that you can then sort into your desired shelves.

## TL;DR

To get the project started:

* clone the project
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Contributing
 This is my interpretation of the my reads seed project from Udacity so feel free to update the code if you desire.
